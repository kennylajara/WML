# World Modeling Language (WML)

**World Modeling Language (WML)** is a programming language designed for modeling real-world systems with ease.
It's meant to facilitate AI research and introduce deterministic instructions into AI model.

> It is currently on Alpha stage and under active development. Do not use it in production.
> That being said, we welcome contributions and feedback from the community.

## Features

- **Ease of Use**: High-level abstractions and user-friendly syntax.
- **Modeling Frameworks**: Built-in libraries and frameworks for defining entities, relationships, and behaviors.

### Future Features

- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient handling of large-scale simulations and complex computations.
- **Interoperability**: Compatibility with other modeling and simulation tools.
- **Visualization Tools**: Advanced options for analyzing and presenting models.
- **Data Integration**: Support for importing and processing real-world data.
- **Simulation Capabilities**: Tools for simulating physical, social, and economic systems.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have Python installed. WML is developed and tested with Python 3.11. Other versions may work, but are not
officially supported (yet).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kennylajara/WML.git
   cd WML
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
